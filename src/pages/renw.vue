You should bear any adverse consequences that may arise on your own.</p><p>Some Apple users can still purchase paid products without logging into their ${appName} account. In such cases, we will record the purchase status based on the device (IMEI code) used by the user when purchasing the product, and bind the third-party payment account to the device.</p><p>If you purchase a paid product without logging into your ${appName} account, but the device is no longer under your control, including but not limited to lost or gifted to others, you can turn off automatic renewal to avoid continuous payment. The closing method can be found in this agreement, which states "Turn off automatic renewal".</p><p>Promotional activities and discounted prices</p><p>We may adjust product prices from time to time based on business needs or market conditions, and disclose them to users on relevant pages. Unless both parties have clearly agreed on the prices for each period when the automatic renewal function is activated for the corresponding product, if the price for automatic renewal is higher than the price at your initial purchase, we will obtain your consent. If the price at the time of automatic renewal is lower than the price at your initial purchase, we will directly deduct the corresponding amount.</p><p>If you obtain an extension of the corresponding product through non paid purchasing methods such as using a redemption code, the start time of automatic renewal will be postponed to the day before the expiration of the product you received the extension.</p><p>Turn off automatic renewal</p><p>You can only turn off the automatic renewal function from a third-party payment account (or system).
